    "I was born in 1989 in Al-Hasaka, Syria and was a very curious and talkative child. I learned programming for the first time using MSX BASIC when I was 9 years old, and I was also fascinated by electronics and the green circuit boards, so I tried to build a small radio when I was 14. After I grew up, I went to college to study Mathematics but when I changed my mind and wanted to study something less abstract, the Syrian revolution has started.",
    "In 2011 to avoid joining the military suppression of Assad's regime, I left to Turkey, after which the course of my life became unstable for the next few years, until I arrived to Germany in 2016."
