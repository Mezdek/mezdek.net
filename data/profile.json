  "story": [
    "Born in 1989 in Al-Hasaka, I’ve always been curious and talkative. My love of learning soon led me to programming, starting with MSX BASIC when I was only 9 years old. I was also fascinated by the green circuit boards of electronics and I began a project to build a small radio at 14. Later, I went on to study mathematics, but I missed the hands-on nature of my projects. I made up my mind to change, but the Syrian revolution had started.",
    "In 2011, to avoid joining the military suppression of Assad’s regime, I left to go to Turkey. After a period of instability, I arrived in Germany in 2016."

    "The natural curiosity that defined me as a child is still guiding me. My interest in etymology has led to a love of language. As well as my native Kurdish and Arabic, I also speak fluent English and German. I even know some Turkish!",
    "My fascination with the world doesn’t stop there. History captivates me, particularly ancient history. I spend my free time volunteering in places I can help others or going for long hikes."
